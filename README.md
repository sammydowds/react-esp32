# Serving a React App from an ESP32

## Motivation

I wanted to play around with a recent ESP32 purchase and blur the lines with my day job (web dev).

TL;DR - Taking the restful_server example provided by espressif and swapping FE to be React + removing code no longer relevant.

Could be a jump off point for making a simple UI for future IO projects.

## Learnings

- I used the esp-idf VS Code extension, which worked out of the box
